# EscapeRoomRoma Project Portfolio

This repository showcases my work on various projects developed for **EscapeRoomRoma**.  
Throughout each project, I focused on:  

- **Understanding and addressing client requirements** through continuous interaction.  
- **Designing hardware prototypes**, including circuit schematics and breadboard implementations.  
- **Developing all the necessary code** to control and automate the systems.  
- **Supervising high-voltage installations** to ensure proper setup and safety.  
- **Conducting testing and calibration** to fine-tune performance.  
- **Performing maintenance** when needed to keep the systems running smoothly.
